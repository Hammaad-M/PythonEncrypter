Purpose: This encrypter uses a multi-layer key-based encryption to allow for undisclosed communication across public platforms. 
Usage: Download and extract the python file. You will need to have downloaded python to run this program. You can do so here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Double-clicking the extracted .py file should open a new terminal where you can choose to encrypt or decrypt. After doing so, you will need to enter a key which will be used to encrypt or decrypt your message accordingly. 
Note: You can only decrypt a message with the key used to encrypt it. 
There is an alternative present to typing the key into the terminal...since you may be using this program many times to encrypt or decrypt with the same key, you can store that key into a local key.txt file in the same directory and simply press 'f' when prompted to enter your key. The program will then read your key from the local key.txt file.
